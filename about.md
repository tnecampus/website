## Brief History of Online Education in Tennessee
In 2001, TBR institutions joined in a cooperative effort to offer undergraduate and graduate degrees, certificates and diplomas online through the Regents Online Degree Program (RODP) which later became known as the Regents Online Campus Collaborative (ROCC). Initially, the jointly-developed programs were created to offer more flexible and accessible education options for adult learners. This development and delivery model became one of the most unique and successful models for online education in the United States receiving numerous awards and accolades.

The online education offered through the cooperative model mirrors the same education offered at physical campus locations. All participating institutions are regionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), while several programs have additional discipline-specific national accreditation status.

Students have the opportunity to choose a "home campus" from among 6 universities awarding Bachelor's and Master's degrees, 13 community colleges providing Associate degrees and 27 colleges of applied technology offering technical certificates and diplomas. Individuals apply for admission, register for courses, and are awarded degrees, diplomas, or certificates from the home campus.
